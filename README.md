Personal Portfolio Website

This personal portfolio website was developed as a requirement for the Web Systems subject to demonstrate my understanding of front-end web development concepts. 
The project applies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly website that presents my personal profile, skills, and sample projects in a professional manner. Through this portfolio, 
I practiced proper file organization, responsive design techniques, basic interactivity, and version control using GitHub, while also gaining a better understanding of UI/UX principles and web deployment using GitHub Pages.
